## User Stories
1. James wants to start waking up earlier. He has had this goal for a year now, but he continues to hit the snooze button for one more hour of sleep. By setting a goal in the Sixty-Six Days app James can now hold himself accountable. If he achieves a goal of 66 consecutive days of waking up early (5 days/week), he can set himself on a path to create a new habit!

2. Jenny wanted to write a blog, but she kept putting it off. This app now gives her a place to keep track of her progress as she pushes herself to finish a blog post at least once a month.

As a user, I should be able to set up my goals, with reminders, and check off if goal is completed or edit, add or delete goals as time progresses.

* This is my second iteration of this app. Reworking it took much longer than I expected. Breaking down code and supplementing it turns out to be very time-consuming!
